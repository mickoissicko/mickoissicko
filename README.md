Cool guy who likes programming oddly specific QoL stuff. I think Github is a cool place to share my projects, even though nobody is going to use them.
I'm currently working on a (grey-area) cheat for Minecraft -- the Pingspoofer, and am also maintaining the USSR project.

A website is in the works as well, and I'm planning to purchase a domain for it; something like `mick.com` or `mick.xyz` will be cool.
